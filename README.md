PDFCanvas

=========

PDFCanvas implements the &lt;canvas&gt; API and renders into a PDF instead of a canvas tag.

I made this as an attmpt at getting Processing.js to render to PDF files.

First simple tests are working, what's NOT WORKING is:

- transforms: scale, rotate, translate, ...
- transparency
- text, fonts
- images
- pixel manipulations
